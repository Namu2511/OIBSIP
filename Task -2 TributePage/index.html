            The Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely
            acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential
            physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the
            theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to
            the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and
            quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics.
            His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from
            relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous
            equation". His work is also known for its influence on the
            philosophy of science.

          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>
            Albert Einstein was born is Ulm, in the Kingdom of Wurttemberg in
            the German Empire, on 14 March 1879 into a family of secular
            Ashkenazi Jews. His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and
            engineer, and Pauline Koch.

          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>
            Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich, from the age
            of five, for three years. At the age of eight, he was transferred to
            the Luitpold-Gymnasium (now known as the Albert-Einstein-Gymnasium),
            where he received advanced primary and secondary school education
            until he left the German Empire seven years later.

          <h2>Personal Life</h2>
          <p>
            Einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the Hebrew
            University of Jerusalem, which opened in 1925 and was among its
            first Board of Governors. Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the
            biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim
            Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university. He also
            submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs.Einstein
            developed an appreciation for music at an early age. In his late
            journals he wrote: "If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a
            musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I
            see my life in terms of music... I get most joy in life out of
            music."

          <h2>Scientific career</h2>
          <p>
            Einstein's first paper submitted in 1900 to Annalen der Physik was
            on capillary attraction. It was published in 1901 with the title
            "Folgerungen aus den Capillarit√§tserscheinungen", which translates
            as "Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena". Two papers he
            published in 1902 - 1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret
            atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These papers were
            the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed
            that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that
            molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned
            with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.

          <h2>Einstein's objections to quantum mechanics</h2>
          <p>
            Einstein played a major role in developing quantum theory, beginning
            with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect. However, he became
            displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after
            1925, despite its acceptance by other physicists. He was skeptical
            that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than
            the result of determinism, stating that God "is not playing at
            dice". Until the end of his life, he continued to maintain that
            quantum mechanics was incomplete.

          <h2>Non-scientific legacy</h2>
          <p>
            While traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted
            stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. The letters were included in the
            papers bequeathed to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Margot
            Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the
            public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after
            her death (she died in 1986[275]).

          <h2>Awards and honors</h2>
          <p>
            Einstein received numerous awards and honors, and in 1922, he was
            awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to
            Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of
            the photoelectric effect". None of the nominations in 1921 met the
            criteria set by Alfred Nobel, so the 1921 prize was carried forward
            and awarded to Einstein in 1922.
